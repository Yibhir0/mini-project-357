      <h2>Research Methods</h2>
      <h3>The Survey</h3>
      <p>
        This research focuses on understanding the challenges of medication
        adherence among individuals with chronic diseases and identifying design
        strategies for a health companion app. By analyzing existing studies,
        including a quantitative survey conducted in France, the research
        highlights key user needs, current medication management practices, and
        the importance of personalized solutions. Addressing these challenges
        through an intuitive and effective application can improve medication
        adherence and overall health outcomes. The study reveals that chronic
        diseases requiring long-term treatment are prevalent, with 40% of
        individuals over the age of 16 in France affected. Current medication
        management practices vary, with 43% of patients using a pillbox,
        indicating a preference for structured tracking tools. However, while
        79% claimed to know all their medications, non-adherence rates suggest a
        gap between knowledge and consistent usage. The study concludes that
        personalized reminders could significantly improve adherence. Rather
        than generic alerts, reminders tailored to individual routines and past
        adherence patterns would be more effective in addressing forgetfulness
        and ensuring long-term engagement. By integrating insights from this
        research, the proposed health companion app should focus on adaptive
        reminders, intuitive medication tracking, and a user-friendly interface.
        Implementing these features can bridge the gap between awareness and
        adherence, providing individuals with chronic diseases with a more
        reliable system for managing their treatments at home.

      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>
        The survey results helped create user personas representing different
        types of users with diverse needs. This approach allowed us to focus on
        the most common pain points and design solutions accordingly.

        Low-fidelity wireframes were created to visualize the app’s structure
        before moving into high-fidelity design.

      <h2>Prototypes</h2>
      <p>
        Prototype screenshots serve as a visual bridge between early design
        concepts and the final user interface. They capture key moments and
        interactions from the prototype, providing stakeholders and team members
        with a tangible glimpse into the app's look, feel, and functionality.
        These snapshots help communicate design intentions clearly, facilitate
        constructive feedback, and support iterative improvements throughout the
        development process. By sharing these visuals, teams can align on the
        user experience and ensure that the design meets both aesthetic and
        functional goals before moving into more detailed development stages.

      <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
      <h3>Testing Goals</h3>
      <p>
        The usability test was conducted remotely to assess the effectiveness,
        ease of use, and accessibility of the Health Companion App. The primary
        objectives included evaluating task completion efficiency, identifying
        usability issues, and gathering qualitative feedback for improvements.
      </p>

      <h3>User Tasks</h3>
      <p>
        Participants were assigned specific tasks such as setting up a
        medication reminder, snoozing reminders, and scheduling a doctor’s
        appointment to simulate real-world usage. These tasks were designed to
        test the core features and identify potential usability issues.
      </p>

      <h3>Feedback Collection</h3>
      <p>
        Feedback was collected through the think-aloud method, structured
        surveys, and follow-up discussions. Participants shared their thoughts
        while navigating the app, answering structured questions about ease of
        use, clarity of instructions, and any challenges faced.
      </p>

      <h3>Analysis and Design Iteration</h3>
      <p>
        Key findings highlighted areas for improvement, including simplifying
        the reminder setup process, enhancing accessibility with larger text and
        higher contrast, and implementing caregiver alerts for dependents. These
        insights guided iterative design improvements to enhance user experience
        and engagement.

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        The UX design process played a crucial role in identifying user needs
        and refining the Health Companion App to create a more intuitive and
        effective experience. Through user research, usability testing, and
        iterative design, the process provided valuable insights into the
        challenges faced by individuals managing chronic health conditions. A
        key challenge was balancing simplicity with functionality, as older
        users required a straightforward interface while younger users preferred
        more customization. This was addressed by implementing a simplified
        default mode with optional advanced settings. Another challenge was
        designing for different user groups, such as caregivers who needed a way
        to monitor medication adherence remotely. This was solved by introducing
        a caregiver mode. Additionally, some users experienced notification
        fatigue, which was mitigated by incorporating adaptive reminders that
        adjusted based on user behavior. Conducting usability testing remotely
        also posed difficulties in gathering real-time insights, but this was
        overcome by using screen recordings, structured surveys, and follow-up
        interviews. Ultimately, the UX design process demonstrated that
        iterative user feedback is essential in creating a product that
        effectively meets real user needs, leading to data-driven improvements
        that enhanced accessibility, engagement, and adherence to medication
        schedules.
