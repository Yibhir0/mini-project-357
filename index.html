      <h2>Research Methods</h2>
      <h3>The Survey</h3>
      <p>
        This research focuses on understanding the challenges of medication
        adherence among individuals with chronic diseases and identifying design
        strategies for a health companion app. By analyzing existing studies,
        including a quantitative survey conducted in France, the research
        highlights key user needs, current medication management practices, and
        the importance of personalized solutions. Addressing these challenges
        through an intuitive and effective application can improve medication
        adherence and overall health outcomes. The study reveals that chronic
        diseases requiring long-term treatment are prevalent, with 40% of
        individuals over the age of 16 in France affected. Current medication
        management practices vary, with 43% of patients using a pillbox,
        indicating a preference for structured tracking tools. However, while
        79% claimed to know all their medications, non-adherence rates suggest a
        gap between knowledge and consistent usage. The study concludes that
        personalized reminders could significantly improve adherence. Rather
        than generic alerts, reminders tailored to individual routines and past
        adherence patterns would be more effective in addressing forgetfulness
        and ensuring long-term engagement. By integrating insights from this
        research, the proposed health companion app should focus on adaptive
        reminders, intuitive medication tracking, and a user-friendly interface.
        Implementing these features can bridge the gap between awareness and
        adherence, providing individuals with chronic diseases with a more
        reliable system for managing their treatments at home.

      <h2>Personas</h2>
      <p>
        The survey results helped create user personas representing different
        types of users with diverse needs. This approach allowed us to focus on
        the most common pain points and design solutions accordingly.
